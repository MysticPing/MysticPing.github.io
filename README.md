This project is for a website that displays and sorts Systembolaget's products by APK (Alcohol per krona). 
It also includes a script for automatically updating the data that runs once per day.

Todo list:
* Allow to sort by availability. For example removing items that can only be ordered online or seasonal items.
* Migrate code from JSON to SQLite
* Allow to sort by traits other than APK, like volume or price.
